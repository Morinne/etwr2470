        <h2>What is Truth?</h2>
        <p><em>Posted 1/1/22</em></p>

        <p>Welcome to the very first Live True blog post! Since we're here at the beginning of beginnings, we should start with the most basic of basics: What is truth? 
	According to Merriam-Webster, truth is "the body of real things, events, and facts." It sounds simple enough until you realize that each person's truth is a perception of reality, not reality itself. </p>
        <p>Your senses gather information about the real world, which your brain then reconstructs it. Your eyes take in specific wavelengths of light, or your skin feels pressure, 
	which gets converted into electrical impulses sent to your brain. Your brain analyzes that information, responds to it, and stores it using electrical and chemical signals, creating 
	a reality influenced by your emotions, history, and knowledge. Even as you read this blog post, you are thinking thoughts, feeling emotions, and making judgments that are unique to you, creating your singular reality.</p>
        <p><img id="rinline" src="./images/cilantro.png" alt="4-14% of people smell cilantro as soap.">To add to the difficulty, even your senses -- how you take in reality -- can differ from others. Think about a simple herb like
	cilantro, that green, leafy plant with a, shall we say, distinctive taste. This sassy little herb causes debates worldwide.</p> 
		<p>For 4-14% of people, it tastes like soap. And they're not imagining it.These cilantro-averse people have smell receptors that are especially good at picking up soap smells. So, for them, adding cilantro to salsa is the same as shredding some soap into it. For the rest of us, it adds a delicious spark of flavor. </p>
        <p>So, what one person perceives as truth may differ from what another person perceives as truth. This relative reality makes it very difficult for people to agree on any truths. Just look at news channels on different ends of the political spectrum, or google "Are eggs bad for you?" and you'll see two very different versions of truth.</p>
        <p>How can we ever know what is true if that's the case? Fortunately, here at Live True our goal is to find our profound, ancestral, <strong>personal</strong> truths. Think of it as an individualized roadmap to you. They are <strong>your</strong> truths because of <strong>your</strong> specific physical and mental limits and needs. Since we will be examining ourselves, we don't need to worry about matching someone else's version of truth. </p>
		<p>Some truths are valid for all of us. For example, we are creatures of movement; we are built to move and move A LOT. If you're sitting all day, you're not doing yourself any favors. But some truths may only be valid for some people. For example, I cannot digest milk. My truth is I'm lactose intolerant. But you may be one of the lucky 32% of people in the world who can chug that milk without the tooty pooty rumble booty. Your truth is all the ice cream. (Yes, I am terribly jealous.) </p>
        <p><img id="linline" src="./images/elvisquote.png" alt="Elvis quote">And even though it can be challenging and even uncomfortable to find our truths, it's vital. As Elvis Presley once said, "Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain't goin' away." If you aren't living your truths, it will eventually catch you. It might be tomorrow, next year, or maybe, like me, not until you hit your late forties. But it will happen. So, I hope you'll join me as I explore potential truths and learn how to apply them to everyday life. Let's Live True!</p>
